# CoinAnalysis
Fetch the list of coins from CoinMarketCap and find their max USD price, then go to ICO drops to find the initial price of the coins. If ICO drops does not have the initial price for a certain coin, the coin's initial price will be entered as 0. Then it calculates the ROI if the coin has an initial price and convert it into a percentage, otherwise it will be entered as "N/A"
